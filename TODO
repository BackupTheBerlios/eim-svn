- configuration file: Use a edb file to store all configuration. We need to
keep a variable inside the file to tell us all configuration
available in the config file. Next we should be able to
restore all the stored configuration. We should
save all account inside one file accounts.edb 


- about the core/*, it must contains of the stuff necessary to
do all possible job with eim (load/save/control connection). 


HIGH URGENCY
- We need to make some important job about the core of EIM.
- In fact, we need to be able to have several Jabber account, so we need
  to manage in the core of eim the configuration of each account, for now 
  nothing has been done in this way. We need to create a core/directory which
  manage all the important stuff of the eim. Load/Save/ each properties using
  the edb_config system.
- prepare callback association, maybe create a structure containing all callback.
  Or maybe we should make a cleaner stuff in function of the protocol used.



LOW URGENCY
- Should change the egxp_message to handle integer tag instead of char * tag.
- Need some improvement in the egxp_message in order to limit buffer copy ...
