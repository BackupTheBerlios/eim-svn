- Work on GUI:
	- Work on menu popup, in fact we want to control all using
	menupopup. So we need to create a mecanism to improve ewl menu.
	- Work on the tree. We should be able to display different 
	representation of the tree. Create a fusion display which regroup 
	all your connection.
	



- about the core/*, it must contains of the stuff necessary to
do all possible job with eim (load/save/control connection). 


HIGH URGENCY
- We need to make some important job about the core of EIM.
- prepare callback association, maybe create a structure containing all callback.
  Or maybe we should make a cleaner stuff in function of the protocol used.



LOW URGENCY
- Should change the egxp_message to handle integer tag instead of char * tag.
- Need some improvement in the egxp_message in order to limit buffer copy ...
