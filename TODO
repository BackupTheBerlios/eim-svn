- implement the xmpp_message_stream to give a connection example
- implement the xmpp_callback_stream_begin_cb to show how handle received data

LOW URGENCY
- Should change the egxp_message to handle integer tag instead of char * tag.
- Need some improvement in the egxp_message in order to limit the buffer copy ...
